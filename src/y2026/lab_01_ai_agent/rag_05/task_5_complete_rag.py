3️⃣ GENERATE: Creating answer...

==================================================
💬 ANSWER:
You can bring your dog to the office on Fridays, designated as "Furry Fridays," provided your dog is well-behaved, up-to-date on vaccinations, and has no history of aggression. You must register your dog with HR before the first visit by providing proof of vaccinations, a behavioral assessment form, and emergency contact information. Additionally, dogs are allowed only in open office areas, designated pet zones, and outdoor spaces—not in the cafeteria, conference rooms, or server rooms.

💬 ANSWER:
TechCorp's remote work policy embraces flexible work arrangements to promote work-life balance and productivity. It outlines a hybrid work model and remote work guidelines. During emergency situations such as weather or health emergencies, 100% remote work may be authorized, with essential personnel notified separately and the business continuity plan activated.
