# MCP (**Anthropic**)

## Overview 
- An MCP server (Model Context Protocol server) 
  - acts as a bridge between "AI models" and "external tools or data sources". 
  - It enables AI to access information and perform actions beyond its built-in knowledge. 
  - In simple terms, an MCP server translates requests from an AI model into **commands** that a specific tool or data source can understand and execute
- **model-agnostic**:  meaning it can work with different AI models and platforms.
- enables developers to create **AI applications** that can:
    - manage context effectively, to do intelligent reasoning and decision-making.
    - integrate with external tools,
    - handle **multi-turn conversations** seamlessly.
- AI agents empowered by MCP can **take actions** 👈🏻
  - LLM only send response 
- **Architecture** (client/server + http/stdio/rpc) 
  - **Components**:
    - **MCP Server** | hosted:  locally, cloud, k8s,  3rd-party vendors
      - 🔸Tools : actions that AI can perform (e.g., database queries, API calls, file operations)
      - 🔸resources: data sources that AI can access (e.g., documents, databases, web pages)
      - 🔸Prompts: predefined instructions/templates to guide AI interactions
    - **MCP Client** ( AI agents, act as clients connecting to MCP servers)
      - 🔸Sampling:
      - 🔸Elicitation: 
      - 🔸Root: FileSystem, DB | eg: keep user preference
    - **MCP SDK**
- **purpose**:
  - MCP makes it easy to build agents and complex workflows, powered by large language models
  - LLMs often need to connect with data and tools. And MCP provides a standard way to do that.
  - Best practices for securing your data within your own infrastructure
