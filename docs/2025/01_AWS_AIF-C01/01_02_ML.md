## ML Algo :: learning types
- **supervised** (label by humans)
![img_1.png](../../99_img/genai/02/img_1.png)
- **unsupervised** : ML algo discover inherent patterns, structures,  or relationships within the **input data**
    - **clustering** : eg: create customer group based on buying pattern + market analysis
    - **Rule Learning Technique** : eg rule-1: keep frequently buy item items together
    - **Anomaly** : bank transaction, figure out unique/unrare txn for fraud detection
- **semi-supervised**
    - mix of both
    - since labeling expensive. cannot label all data.
- **self-supervised**  (auto-labelling)
    -  first create multiple Pre-task
    - solve this pre-task
    - creates pseudo labels for tuning
    - complex process.
    - chatGPT, BERT uses this.
- **RL / reinforcement learning**
    - self learn by ML model
    - **agent, env, action, reward() fn**
    - **agent** learns by performing **actions** in **env** to maximize **award**
    - used in gaming/chess, car driving self, finance  for strategic decision ,etc

- **RLHF / reinforcement learning by human feedback**
    - reward fn in RL --> replace with human rewards
    - Model1 learns by response/human feedbacks ⬅️
    - eg: used alot in LLM model, sometime chatGPT gives answer1 or answer2 ? ask to pick one.
    - human feedback goes in **reward-model** ⬅️
    - and this reward-model will be used to give reward in future
    - so  indirectly rewarded from human response

## 👈✔️Model
### traditional DL Model
- collect > prep > label > train > model-1 (static)
- collect > prep > label > train > model-2 (static)
- Specific to one task
- eg: spam email detection, image classification, sentiment analysis

### IDP (Intelligent document processing)

### NLP (ML model)
- text classification
- sentiment analysis
- machine translation
- language generation.

### Computer vision (ML model)
- makes it possible for computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos.
- image classification
- object detection
- image segmentation

### Wavenet model
- model to generate raw audio waveform, used in Speech Synthesis

### KNN Model
- model use for classification  in supervised learning
- eg: learn pattern and figure out spam email.

### GAN :: Generative Adversarial Network
- models used to generate **synthetic data**
- such as images, videos or sounds that resemble the training data.
- Helpful for data augmentation
