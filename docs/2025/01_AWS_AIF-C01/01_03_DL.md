# Deep learning
## NN ( Neural network )
- tiny Nodes, connected together
- node talking and identify patterns
- These nodes are organized into **layers**
- stack of layers : input >> hidden/s >> putput
- each performing a specific transformation on the data as it passes through
- freeze/unfreeze some layers so their weights don’t change, turning training.
```
  Input Layer (simple)    : Takes raw data (e.g., an image’s pixels).
  Hidden Layers           : Intermediate layers that learn features like edges, shapes, textures.
  ...
  ...
  Output Layer (complex)  : Produces the final prediction (e.g., “cat” or “dog”).

```
- **epoch** :
    - training happens over many epochs to help the model learn better
    - during model training, one complete pass through.
    - If having 1000 training examples, 1 epoch means the model has seen all 1000 examples once.
- **weight**
    - parameters inside a neural network that the model learns and updates during training
    - control how input data is transformed as it passes through the network
    - Training adjusts these weights to minimize errors and improve predictions.

## RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
- neural network to learn from  sequence data like time series, text, or speech and predict
- **GRU** Gated Recurrent Unit
- **LSTM** Long Short-Term Memory

## ResNet (Residual Network)
– Neural Network (CNN) used for image recognition tasks, object detection, facial recognition
