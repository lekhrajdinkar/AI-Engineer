## Application/s of AI
- **Natural language processing** ( NLP > LLM ) 👈🏻
    - deals with the interaction between computers and human languages
    - Deep learning has made significant strides in NLP
    - task: text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and language generation
    - **example**: ◀️
        - Telecommunication companies use NLP to **analyze customer text messages and suggest personalized recommendations**.
        - education industry, students use Q&A chatbots to address questions.
        - Insurance companies can use NLP to extract policy numbers, expiration dates, and other personal information.
      
- **Computer vision**
  - DL has revolutionized computer vision 
  - by providing powerful techniques: image classification, object detection, image segmentation.
  - **example**: ◀️
    - Auto industry, self-driving cars safer and more reliable. 
    - facial-recognition can swiftly identify unlawful entries or persons. 

- **intelligent document processing (IDP)**
  - IDP is an application that extracts and classifies information from **unstructured** data, 
  - then generates summaries, and provides actionable insights
  - uses - NLP and OCR optical character recognition
  - **examples**: ◀️
    - medical : processing various document types, such as claims and doctor’s notes.
    - legal : processing documents such as contractual documents, agreements, court filings, and legal dockets
    - helps with the underwriting process by 
      - identifying incomplete tax forms, pay stubs, and other missing data

- **fraud detection**
  - **example**:◀️
    - payment fraud detection, transaction surveillance, and anti-money laundering (AML) sanctions.
    - Credit card and online retail fraud
    - New account fraud, claims processing fraud, and promotion abuse
    - telecom: Roaming, premium rate service, and subscription fraud
